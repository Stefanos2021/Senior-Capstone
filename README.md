 I was able to map out the logical solutions and see the project in a different lense! I made adjustments to my project as needed. I display the connections and the libraries used in my application. AntZlibrary was a great resource to design the UI, and Kendo was used for the scheduler. I ended using 2 apis with over 14 endpoints!
