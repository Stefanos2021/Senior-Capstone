### Project Introduction : Problem we are trying to solve
At Work Time And Attendance our team strives to achieve one
simple goal, provide the best product while ensuring the highest quality service. For
companies that are looking to stay up to date with the latest technologies or have simply
outgrown their current HR infrastructure, Workx is here to help. Managing the employee
experience is something our team values and believes if there is a centralized place for
them to punch into work and view their schedules less time will be wasted. Through this
software, executives will have administrative accounts with access to a dashboard to
conduct their tasks in an aesthetically pleasing platform. The dashboard will be used to
perform a range of operations to make sure the employees are organized and have a
successful experience. Avoiding unforced errors made by outdated or overly complex
technology is something we aim to push our partners away from
