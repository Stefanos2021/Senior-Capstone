# WorkxTimeAndAttendance

## Welcome to my Senior Capstone ReadMe File. 

### Link to Portfolio Website where you can download and see more about this project and my other ventures!

### Project Introduction : Problem we are trying to solve
At Work Time And Attendance our team strives to achieve one
simple goal, provide the best product while ensuring the highest quality service. For
companies that are looking to stay up to date with the latest technologies or have simply
outgrown their current HR infrastructure, Workx is here to help. Managing the employee
experience is something our team values and believes if there is a centralized place for
them to punch into work and view their schedules less time will be wasted. Through this
software, executives will have administrative accounts with access to a dashboard to
conduct their tasks in an aesthetically pleasing platform. The dashboard will be used to
perform a range of operations to make sure the employees are organized and have a
successful experience. Avoiding unforced errors made by outdated or overly complex
technology is something we aim to push our partners away from

## Technologies Chosen: Industry Best Practices : Cloud Deployment : Dev Ops Principles

- Database: MongoDB, This database was chosen because I wanted to build an enterprise
application that was not sql based. Since the industry is moving towards this direction, I
felt confident that this would be a great experience based on the content I viewed on their
main documentation site.

- Front End : Angular-JS, This framework was chosen because it leveraged the MVC
architecture. Frameworks that support the MVC architecture is something I felt really
comfortable with prior to this capstone. Knowing this and the rise of popularity Angular
has in the software development realm made this a great choice. Additionally, the amount
of support this has with my chosen backend framework made it an extremely stable
framework.

- Back End : Java - Spring Boot, Spring Boot was chosen because of its simplicity as a
framework. Spring Boot when researched was a very stable framework that was
extremely intriguing when I first was introduced to it. Compared to other frameworks I
saw with Java, Spring Boot also worked great with a variety of Front End Frameworks
like Angular making this a great choice.

- Cloud Deployment: This application was deployed to the cloud in Azure and is currently
set up with a build pipeline within the platform.

- DevOps Principles: . The DevOps principles that were applied in this process were
understanding the flow of work, not passing defects downstream, and testing my code
before deployments properly. Being mindful of potential log file issues and print lines in
critical health portions of the app was something I was extremely mindful of.
